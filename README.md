Kurtosis-based projection pursuit analysis (PPA) was developed as an alternative exploratory data analysis algorithm. Instead of using variance and distance metrics to obtain, hopefully, informative projections of high-dimensional data (like PCA, HCA, and kNN), ordinary PPA searches for interesting projections by optimizing the kurtosis. However, if the sample-variable ratio is too low, it is possible for ordinary PPA to "overmodel" the data by finding spurious combinations of the original variables that give a low kurtosis value. To overcome this, one can compress their data with PCA prior to applying PCA (~10:1 sample-to-variable ratio). To make PPA independent of PCA, we have developed a sparse implementation of PPA (SPPA), where subsets of the orgiinal variables are selected using a gentic algorithm. This repository contains MATLAB code that can be used to apply SPPA to high-dimensional chemical data, examples of SPPA in use, and the corresponding paper published on SPPA. Below is a figure from our recent paper that shows the basic approach of the algorithm.
